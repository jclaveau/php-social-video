Video ids and thumbnails (Based on the work of lingtalfi [video-ids-and-thumbnails](https://github.com/lingtalfi/video-ids-and-thumbnails))
=============================
2017-08-29



The php class I use to get the video ids and thumbnails from youtube, vimeo and dailymotion.


The functions are in the [SocialVideo.php] file.


I also wrote some pre-tests to showcase the functions.
Those pre-tests are in the [testvideo.php] file.
